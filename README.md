# Weather-Geo
QED-challenge

For this application I used Bootsstrap (containing Jquery and Popper.js) for the function and html part and lite-server in order to host the application.

First I created the basic Html part with some css classes in order to get a hand on how the application should look and made changes to it live using lite-server (calling npm run lite)
After that I created the index.js file in which the function for getting the location and weather can be found and called.
Lastly I added some more css classes and customised a bit the app to give it a better appearance. 

The app displays the location, day, temperature and forecast for 3 days. (Today, Tommorow and the day after. the weather api restricted the forecast for only those days).

Also tryed:
Adding the icons for the forecast, but the icon would not load.
Createin my own server to host the app, but only the html part is displayed, without the fuctions from index.js (you can check this using npm start).
